# Company Game

1. World is split into countries, companies and cooporations
1. World is also split up into resource zones
1. "Nodes" are built on the world which represent all the types of buildings:
    1. Resource exploitation (e.g. mines, lumberyards)
    1. Population centre (e.g. village, town, city)
    1. Depots (e.g. warehouses)
    1. Factories
1. Connections are built between the nodes, with connections having maximum lengths depending on the terminal node types
1. All of these can be player controlled
1. Players are started with a single company (e.g. mining).
1. Companies can own buildings and resources (e.g. a mine, a warehouse, a processing plant). They are ran by a single person.
1. Cooporations can own companies, and can also own resources. They are run by a group of stakeholders, or a single person if they are private.
1. Countries contain companies (companies cannot cross international borders). Coorporations can, unless a country forbids them.
1. Countries own land, they tax on trades that happen within their borders, and have ultimate power to allow or disallow the selling and use of land. A countries aim is to produce certain types of resources to complete quests, which award them with points they can spend improving their country and ultimately winning the game.
